            The Industrial Engineering and Operations Research group under the Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a M.Tech degree. The M.Tech
            programme is carefully designed, with the right mix of tools, techniques, theory and applications, to prepare students for a professional career
            in the area. The curriculum involves compulsory courses, electives and a 14 month long research project (M.Tech thesis). Through the research work, 
            the student is expected to exhibit the ability to think independently and make significant contributions in the field of IEOR. The duration
            of the M.Tech course for full time students is 4 semesters (2 years) and for part time students is 6 semesters (3 years).

                M.S. (Research) Programme

        <p>
            The Industrial Engineering and Operations Research group under the Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a M.S. (Research) degree. 
            The M.S. (Research) programme is a special research-oriented Masters programme offered to students who are interested in exploring 
            in-depth research problems in any area of IEOR. The emphasis is on conducting original research and writing a thesis of publishable quality. 
            Interested students who have demonstrated excellence in their academic performance and research potential may convert to the Ph.D. programme.
            <br>
            <br>
            The main differences with the M.Tech programme are:
            <ol>
                <li> The M.S.(R) programme has 36-15 ratio of credits for research to credits of course work versus a 20-40 ratio in the M.Tech programme.</li>
                <li> There are no fixed core courses. Instead each individual student is advised on courses to take based on their research interests and background.
                </li>
                <li> Full-time students are expected to identify their thesis advisor by the end of their first semester, and begin research in the second semester.</li>
            </ol>

            <u>
                Ph.D. Programme
            </u>
            
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Industrial Engineering and Operations Research group under the Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a Ph.D. degree
            for students with M.Tech/B.Tech/BE/M.Sc. entering (qualifying) degree who gain admission and satisfy the requirements of the programme.
            The Ph.D. programme is also available for students post B.Sc. in Mathematics or Statistics, through the JAM/GATE score. 
            Graduates of the Ph.D. programme demonstrate their ability to make original and significant contributions in the field of IEOR 
            through dissertation work. 
            The academic programme leading to the Ph.D. degree involves course-credit requirements and research work culminating in a dissertation.

        <h3>
            <u>Ph.D. confirmation and comprehensive examination</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The student's qualification-wise (i.e., based on entering degree) credit requirements are decided and administered by the DRC (Department Research Committe), subject to minimum course credit requirements as prescribed by the Institute norms. Upon successful completion of the course requirements, and after clearing the comprehensive examination the Ph.D. registration of the student is confirmed, subject to the following requirements. Grade requirements for Ph.D. confirmation: The students need to maintain a CPI of at least 7.00 at any time during the course of their Ph.D. to continue the Ph.D. This will include all the prescribed coursework. Comprehensive Exam for Ph.D confirmation: All students have to clear the comprehensive exam to qualify for Ph.D. The grade requirement and comprehensive exam are independent requirements. Both need to be satisfied for confirmation of Ph.D. registration.

        <h3>
            <u>Supervisor(s), Student Research Committe (SRC)</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ph.D. students are encouraged to interact with all faculty members, and based on their research interest, sign up with any faculty as their Ph.D. Supervisor. Joint or Co-Supervision is also possible. In consultation with his/her Supervisor, the Student Research Committee (SRC) is setup. Details of these too are to be submitted along with the Ph.D. confirmation form. The Annual Progress Review (APR) is an annual review of the studentâ€™s research progress by the SRC. The first APR is held in the 3rd semester (1 year) from joining.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <u>Research work</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The candidate eventually submits to the Institute a Thesis which is judged by a panel of experts (both from IIT Delhi and external) for "its contribution to advancement of knowledge." Periodic dissemination of their findings in conferences, academic journals and factoring in the feedback of peer community is encouraged. Placement after completion of the programme is strongly influenced by this activity.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <u>Scholarships and Support</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Institute TA scholarship is for a period of 5 years. This is the duration within which Ph.D. students should normally attempt to finish their requirements and submit their thesis. Students admitted with scholarships (UQIDAR) will be governed by the rule of those scholarships. Ph.D. students can apply for PMRF fellowship too, as per PMRF guidelines.

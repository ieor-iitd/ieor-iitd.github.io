            Faculty Recruitment 
        </h2>

        <p>
            IIT Delhi invites applications for faculty positions from distinguished professionals, 
            including those with non-academic or industrial backgrounds.
            We strongly encourage individuals from SC/ST/OBC/EWS categories, as well as persons with disabilities,to apply.
            We are seeking top experts across a wide range of disciplines. 
            Faculty applications are accepted throughout the year on a rolling basisâ€”there is no deadline to apply.
            Please note that the faculty recruitment process at IIT Delhi is multi-stage and rigorous.
            Applications are first screened by administrative staff to ensure they meet the minimum eligibility criteria.
            Eligible applications are then evaluated by the relevant academic units. Shortlisted candidates are invited for an extended interaction with the faculty members.
            The most outstanding candidates proceed to a final interview conducted by the Institute Selection Committee,
            which includes eminent international experts and a nominee of the Hon'ble Visitor. The recommendations from
            this committee are compiled into a compendium, which is presented to the Board of Governors for final approval.
            Given the comprehensive nature of the process, it may take up to six months or longer for a final decision.
        </p>

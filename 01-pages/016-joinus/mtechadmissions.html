        <p>
            The Institute runs a number of M. Tech./ M. Tech (High-Value Assistantship) and M. S. (Research)
            programmes offered by various Departments, Centres, and Schools. M. Tech. and M.S.(R)
            programmes mainly differ in the fraction of course and project/thesis credits. M. Tech.
            programmes may have up to two- thirds of the credits for the course work, while M.S.(R)
            programmes have two-thirds of the credits for the thesis component. Some of these programmes
            are interdisciplinary programmes (IDP) where multiple academic units are involved. In these IDPs,
            students with different backgrounds are eligible to be admitted to the programme. IDPs are
            administered through a Programme Executive Committee or PEC. In these programmes, either
            industry supports full-time students recruited by the Institute, or sponsors their employees for the
            programme. In either case, regular industry feedback is obtained to adopt and improve the
            curriculum to the needs of the industry. Industry sponsors also play a significant role in defining
            the projects.

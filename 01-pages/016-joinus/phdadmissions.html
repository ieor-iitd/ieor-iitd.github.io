        <p>
            Admission to the Ph.D. programmes is normally made on
            the basis of an interview of eligible candidates conducted by the Department/Centre/School
            concerned, through its Department Research Committee (DRC) / Centre Research Committee
            (CRC)/ School Research Committee (SRC). DRC/CRC/SRC may decide to conduct a written test as
            well, or multiple interviews, or other ways or testing, in order to screen the candidates.
            Applications are invited from candidates by advertising the programmes in Employment
            News/web portals in March for the first semester and in October for the second semester every
            year.
        </p>

            <u>Admission Schedule</u>
            
        </h2>
        <p>
            Normally, Ph.D. programmes are advertised in the month of March and
            October each year, and test/interviews are carried out in the months of May and December.
            Further, admission to the Ph.D. programme is possible at any time of the year with the application
            being processed and candidates interviewed by the respective DRC/CRC/SRC. Ph.D. scholars can
            join the Institute at any time of the year, though the course registration will be possible only at
            the beginning of the subsequent semester. Such candidates must also fulfill the required academic
            qualification / experience at the time of the interview. They must join the Institute within 4 weeks
            after the issue of admission offer unless specifically permitted otherwise. Admission is subject to
            the vacancy being available in the relevant specializations.

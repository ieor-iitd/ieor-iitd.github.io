        <h2>Postdoctoral Fellow (PDF)</h2>
    
        <p>
            IIT Delhi invites applications from highly qualified and motivated individuals for the position of 
            Postdoctoral Fellow (PDF) in various academic units. A postdoctoral fellowship is an 
            advanced research opportunity offered to scholars who have recently completed their Ph.D. and are looking 
            to deepen their expertise and broaden their academic and research credentials.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Postdoctoral Fellows at IIT Delhi engage in independent and collaborative research under the mentorship of 
            faculty members. The primary objective is to enhance their research capabilities, contribute to ongoing 
            projects, and develop a foundation for future academic or industry careers. In addition to research, PDFs are 
            expected to contribute to the teaching activities of their respective academic units — typically up to 20% of 
            their time — by assisting in instruction, mentoring students, or developing course content.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The institute provides a stimulating environment with access to world-class infrastructure and resources. PDFs 
            are entitled to various benefits, including on-campus accommodation, a 
            Professional Development Allowance (PDA), access to research facilities, and support for 
            attending national/international conferences.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Eligibility criteria include minimum educational qualifications (Ph.D.), relevant research experience, and 
            upper age limits, with relaxations for women and persons with disabilities. IIT Delhi is committed to 
            diversity and encourages applications from candidates across all backgrounds.
